## ðŸ”¨ What's next?

## ðŸŽ¨ Where to find everything?

The project is structured as follows:

`src/main/java/` contains the main Java code.
The controllers are in the controller package.
`src/main/resources/` contains the application properties, static resources (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript files), and the templates.

### Database

Dynamic spaces can use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html) database.  
The database file is called `database.db`. It is placed inside the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder.  
SQLite connection path to the database is `w3s-dynamic-storage/database.db` which you can use to connect to the SQLite database programmatically.   

---  
**Do not change the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name!**  
**By changing the `w3s-dynamic-storage` folder name or `database.db` file name, you risk the space not working properly.**

## ðŸ”¨ Please note

For now, files created/uploaded or edited from within the terminal view will not be backed up or synced.
